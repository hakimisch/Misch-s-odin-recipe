        <h6>Recipe instructions</h6>
        <li>First rinse the rice under cold, running water for a few minutes and drained. The water does not need to run perfectly clear but rinsing helps get rid of starch that can make the rice sticky. Then place the drained rice in a rice cooker.</li>
        <li>The rice must be good. Any types of rice can be used but use a good quality rice. Basmati rice is perfect for this coconut milk rice.</li>
        <li>Pour 50ml or 1/4 of the thick coconut milk (200ml / from 1 coconut) into a measuring cup. Then dilute with some water.</li>
        <li>Add in salt and sugar and stir to mix. Do not add salt and sugar after rice is cooked as this will cause the rice to be overly salty.</li>
        <li>Use thick coconut milk. This milky white liquid is obtained after adding water to freshly grated coconut and giving it a good squeeze or press. The thickness or creaminess of coconut milk is determined by the amount of water added. This squeezed coconut cream can also be store bought.</li>
